					<h2>The logo</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							When Filippo first started his business, he was
							searching for a logo that could become recognizable,
							easily memorable, and that could grow alongside his
							business.
						</p>
						<p>
							The result had to be something simple that could
							represent his brand: Cesana Jewels. From the very
							beginning, the initials stood out; all that was
							needed was a graphic form that could express
							professionalism and preciousness, while maintaining
							a modern and captivating approach.
						</p>
						<p>
							After several comparisons and studies of various
							drafts, we chose the only solution that incorporated
							all the necessary characteristics.
						</p>

							src="../src/img/project/CJ/CJ_logo.png"
							class="d-flex flex-fill mh-50 mw-100 mx-auto py-4"
							alt="CJ logos"
						/>
					</div>

					<h2>Merchandise and promotional items</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							Subsequently, we worked on the materials required
							for use on social media, product packaging, and to
							best convey his brand image.
						</p>
						<p>
							I provided the graphics for the labels, both in
							large format for advertising and public
							distribution, and for application to the packaging.
						</p>

							class="d-flex flex-fill mh-50 mw-100 mx-auto py-4"
							alt="CJ Merchandise"
						/>
						<p>
							Additionally, Filippo was provided with all the
							materials necessary to maintain a consistent and
							cohesive image for his social media profile, but
							above all, I designed an animation to be used in his
							commercials and videos.
						</p>

							class="d-flex flex-fill mh-50 mw-100 mx-auto py-4"
							alt="CJ Intro video"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						The video was created using 3D modeling and animation in
						Blender. The final result was rendered in 8K to be used
						in the commercials, event at cinematic quality.
