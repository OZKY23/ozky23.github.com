					<h2>The starting point</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							With Alessandro we talked about his current
							situation and explored the methodologies with which
							he carries out his activities, I tried to gather
							information on the elements he wanted to renew and
							asked some questions to understand how to satisfy
							his requests by applying the latest technologies.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the first meeting we identified three thematic
							areas in which to operate:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Brand renewal (logo redesign and coordinated
								image)
							</li>
							<li>Website update with new features</li>
							<li>
								Material for work activities (print templates)
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							And we established the priorities and times in which
							to carry out the activities, optimizing everything
							to avoid disruptions to customers and in the
							management of its services, especially for what concerns the website.
						</p>

						<p>So, let's start.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Build the fundations</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							Alessandro's logo was purely typographic, although
							the choice was in line with the style and target of
							the brand, the starting solution lacked
							characterizing elements and capable of making the
							Conti brand recognizable and unique.
						</p>
						<p>
							After some considerations and drafts, a clean
							solution was chosen that would not distort the
							recognizability but would increase its refinement:
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Let's get our hands dirty</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							Once the fun part was established, it was time to
							start applying the new logo consistently on all the
							elements characterizing the brand.
						</p>

						<p>
							Given the various uses of the logo (digital, screen
							printing, vinyl, embroidery), we avoided associating
							colors in the coordinated image for a more flexible
							use, but for a more far-sighted planning we found
							together the palette that best suited the
							personality of the service, also taking into account
							the character who represents it: Alessandro himself.
						</p>

						<p>
							At this point it was possible to proceed to produce
							the first results, starting from some merchandise
							proposals up to the actual products to be delivered
							together with the services (certificates, website logo, newsletters,etc.)
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2>The website</h2>

					<div>
						<p>Up to this point, the website has not been altered in any way, as the main channel for reporting and interfacing with customers, with the exception of updating the logo and aligning the chosen palette.</p>
						<p>The changes requested to the site were total, mainly due to the dated WYSIWYG writing engine that made SEO optimization difficult, furthermore it turned out to be a tool of little use to the customer and that we understood could be abandoned in favor of a more flexible and automated content management where needed and well studied upstream in the less variable points.</p>
						<p>In this way, it was possible to drastically reduce page loading times, optimize SEO positioning and simplify the management of purchases by the customer, with a notable gain also for the ease of navigation of users.</p>
						<p>But beyond the more technical aspects, the need emerged to adapt navigation to a new service model planned by the client. In particular, we wanted to integrate the website with two sections for sharing, purchasing and managing workshops and for a series of courses held by the client.</p>
						<p>The final agreed site map was:</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Conclusions</h2>

					<div>
						<p>The project required working on multiple aspects and maintaining stylistic coherence as well as providing quality and reliable solutions to the customer.</p>

						<p> The integration of external services (TrustPilot, Instagram, etc.) allowed not only to optimize SEO but also to build a more reliable and solid brand image.</p>

						<p>The results can be seen in the continuous growth and healthiness of the brand, certainly thanks to the professionalism and quality of the work done by Alessandro but who will now be able to take advantage of more performing and simple tools to use with his customers.</p>
